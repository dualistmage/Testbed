[18] We further show that instead of using an off-the-shelf summarization technique that is designed for pure-text summarization, it is possible to design specialized summarization methods catering to Web-page structures.
[17] In this paper, we show that using Web-page summarization techniques for preprocessing in Web-page classification is a viable and effective technique.
[59] To summarize, our aim is to apply Web-page summarization to Web-page classification, rather than using pure-text summarization for the purpose.
[21] In addition, in this paper, we also propose a new automatic Web summarization algorithm, which extracts the main topic of a Web page by a page-layout analysis to enhance the accuracy of classification.
[6] Experimental results show that our proposed summarization-based classification algorithm achieves an approximately 8.8% improvement as compared to pure-text-based classification algorithm.
[97] In order to make use of these objects, from the above types of objects, we define the Content Body (CB) of a Web page which consists of the main objects related to the topic of that page; these are the objects that convey important information about the page.
[257] In this paper, several Web-page summarization algorithms are proposed for extracting the most relevant features from Web pages for improving the accuracy of Web classification.
[131] Firstly, we test the Web page classification on the human created summaries in order to find out whether the summarization can help classification of Web pages at all.
[2] Web-page classification is much more difficult than pure-text classification due to a large variety of noisy information embedded in Web pages.
