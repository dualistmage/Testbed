[63] Since the context information may be related to the target Web page but contains no clues for summarization, Delort et al. proposed two enhanced Web-page summarization methods using hyperlinks [5].
[4] However, such methods fail to uncover the full knowledge associated with a Web page needed in building a high-quality summary, because many of these methods do not consider the hidden relationships in the Web.
[48] In conjunction with the proposed summarization methods, the thematic lexicon can be used to complement the scarcity problem of Web-page content, even when no clickthrough data are collected associated with these pages.
[3] Most previous Web-page summarization methods treat a Web page as plain text.
[7] We first analyze the feasibility in utilizing the clickthrough data to enhance Web-page summarization and then propose two adapted summarization methods that take advantage of the relationships discovered from the clickthrough data.
[16] Web-page summarization is also useful when users access Internet via small-display devices such as the personal digital assistants (PDA's), since it is hard to fit the original content of a Web page into a small screen [3].
[257] The extract-summary of each page is generated by our proposed summarization algorithms and the leading characters of length equal with the description sentences are used for evaluation.
[247] All the above experiments indicate the clickthrough data are helpful for generic Web-page summarization and both our proposed methods can leverage this knowledge source well.
[246] Even the real queries of Web pages are dropped, the thematic lexicon-based methods can still lead to better summaries compared with local textual content based summarizers, although the performance is not so good as that of page-query based methods.
[237] If terms under this category have more than P % overlap with distinct terms in the Web page, then they are used for summarization.
