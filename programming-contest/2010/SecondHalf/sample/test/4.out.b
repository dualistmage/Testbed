[154] DomPS is still the worst, and FixedPS is slightly better.
[191] In our experiments, top 10 terms are selected to expand the original query.
[7] The Web today contains documents that are highly volatile, distributed and heterogeneous.
[217] For TREC 2001, if compared with baseline, CombPS, VIPS, FixedPS are all significant (p-value is 0.0236, 0.0245 and 0.0466, respectively).
[73] Typical visual hints include lines, blank areas, colors, pictures, fonts, etc.
