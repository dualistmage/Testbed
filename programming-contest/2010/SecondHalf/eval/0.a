[38] In this paper, we formally define the major tasks of Topic Modeling with Network Structure (TMN), and propose a unified framework to combine statistical topic modeling with network analysis by regularizing the topic model with a discrete regularizer defined based on the network structure.
[65] Based on the definitions of these concepts, we can formalize the major tasks of topic modeling with network structure (TMN) as follows: Task 1: (Topic Extraction) Given a collection C and a network structure G, the task of Topic Extraction is to model and extract k major topic models, {1 , ..., k }, where k is a user specified parameter.
[11] Figure 1: A sample network structure with text These examples show that in many web mining tasks, we are often dealing with collections of text with a network structure attached, making it interesting to study how we can leverage the associated network structure to discover interesting topic and/or network patterns.
[112] We propose a new framework to model topics with a network structure, by regularizing a statistical topic model with a regularizer on the network.
[206] Specifically, Topic 1 well corresponds to the information retrieval (SIGIR) community, Topic 2 is closely related to the data mining (KDD) community, Topic 3 covers the machine learning (NIPS) community, and Topic 4 well covers the topic that is unique to the conference of WWW.
[66] Task 2: (Topic Map Extraction) Given a collection C and a network structure G, the task of Topic Map Extraction is to model and extract the k weight vectors {M1 , ..., Mk }, where each vector M is a map of topic  on network G.
[321] The concrete applications we introduced in Section 4 are also related to existing work on author-topic analysis [26, 20], spatiotemporal text mining [19, 20], and blog mining [9, 19]. [30] explores co-author network to estimate the Markov transition probabilities between topics, which uses the network structure as a post processing step of topic modeling.
[58] Definition 4 (Topic Map): A topic map of a topic  on network G, M , is represented by a vector of weights f (, v1 ), f (, v2 ), ..., f (, vm ) , where vi  V , and f (, v) is a weighting function of a topic on a vertex.
[20] On the other hand, social network analysis (SNA) focuses on the topology structure of a network [11, 13, 1, 12], addressing questions such as "what the diameter of a network is [13]", "how a network evolves [13, 1]", "how information diffuses on the network [9, 14]", and "what are the communities on a network [11, 1]."
[348] We propose a general solution of text mining with network structure, which optimizes the likelihood of topic generation and the topic smoothness on the graph in a unified way.
