[160] For each query, the volunteer was shown 2 result rankings; one consisted of the top 10 results satisfying the query, when these results were ranked with the unbiased PageRank vector, and the other consisted of the top 10 results for the query when the results were ranked with the composite sqd score.12 The volunteer was asked to select all URLs which were "relevant" to the query, in their opinion.
[3] By using these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate query-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic PageRank vector.
[1] In the original PageRank algorithm for improving the ranking of search-query results, a single PageRank vector is computed, using the link structure of the Web, to capture the relative "importance" of Web pages, independent of any particular search query.
[10] algorithm proposed in [14] relies on query-time processing to deduce the hubs and authorities that exist in a subgraph of the Web consisting of both the results to a query and the local neighborhood of these results. [4] augments the HITS algorithm with content analysis to improve precision for the task of retrieving documents related to a query topic (as opposed to retrieving documents that exactly satisfy the user's information need). [8] makes use of HITS for automatically compiling resource lists for general topics.
[85] At query time, these importance scores are combined based on the topics of the query to form a composite PageRank score for those pages matching the query.
[4] For ordinary keyword search queries, we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords.
[13] At query time, these importance scores are used in conjunction with query-specific IR scores to rank the query results.
[5] For searches done in context (e.g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a Web page), we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared.
[45] In this scenario, we determine the topics most closely associated with the query, and use the appropriate topic-sensitive PageRank vectors for ranking the documents satisfying the query.
[16] In this paper, we propose an approach that (as with HITS) allows the query to influence the link-based score, yet (as with PageRank) requires minimal query-time processing.
