[94] Correspondingly, we introduce four multinomial distributions: (1) B is a background topic model to capture common English words; (2)  = {1 , ..., k } are k topic models to capture neutral descriptions about k global subtopics in the collection; (3) P is a positive sentiment model to capture positive opinions; and (4) N is a negative sentiment model to capture negative opinions for all the topics in the collection.
[79] (2) Extracting Topic Models and Sentiment Coverages: Given a collection of Weblog articles and the general sentiment models learnt, customize the sentiment models to this collection, extract the topic models, and extract the sentiment coverages.
[78] Based on the concepts above, we define the major tasks of Topic-Sentiment Analysis (TSA) on weblogs as: (1) Learning General Sentiment Models: Learn a sentiment model for positive opinions and a sentiment model for negative opinions, which are general enough to be used in new unlabeled collections.
[80] (3) Modeling Topic Life Cycle and Sentiment Dynamics: Model the life cycles of each topic and the dynamics of each sentiment associated with that topic in the given collection.
[316] In a very recent work [4], the author proposed a topic dependent method for sentiment retrieval, which assumed that a sentence was generated from a probabilistic model consisting of both a topic language model and a sentiment language model.
[352] With this model, we could effectively (1) learn general sentiment models; (2) extract topic models orthogonal to sentiments, which can represent the neutral content of a subtopic; and (3) extract topic life cycles and the associated sentiment dynamics.

[328] that the TSM model is a special case of some very general topic models, such as the CPLSA model [17], which mixes themes with different views (topic, sentiment) and different coverages (sentiment coverages).
[77] Being consistent with topic life cycles, we model the sentiment dynamics with the amount of text associated with topic  that is generated with each sentiment model.
[203] Table 3: Sentiment models learnt from a mixture of topics are more general The left two columns in Table 3 present the two sentiment models extracted from the 10-topic-mixture dataset, which is more general than the right two columns and two in the middle, which are extracted from two single-topic data sets ("movies" and "cities") respectively.
