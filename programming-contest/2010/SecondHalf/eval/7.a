[3] This paper elucidates the differences between search systems for the Web and those for enterprises, with an emphasis on the future of enterprise search systems.
[4] It also introduces the Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) and provides the context for the unstructured information management (UIM) papers that follow.
[2] Exploiting this information requires systems for managing and extracting knowledge from large collections of unstructured data and applications for discovering patterns and relationships.
[87] He currently has responsibility for the information and knowledge management department as well as the Research Division s world-wide strategy in the area of unstructured information management.
[67] The field of UIM may come full circle: while the unstructured search paradigm on the Web exploded in the consumer sphere before being adopted in the enterprise, we believe that the combination of semantic and linguistic annotations with unstructured
[19] Thus, it seems that search and knowledge management in the enterprise should be improving and may indeed be easier than on the Web.
[36] We submit that the "missing part" is the architecture that enables the integration of the technologies described above with search and retrieval.
[58] One component of this system gathers daily market information from multiple sources: Web sites, file systems, mail servers, etc.
[88] This includes the work of several hundred researchers in the area of natural language processing (NLP), advanced search and information retrieval, text analysis, machine translation, automated document generation, and the application of human-computer-interaction User-Centered Design to a wide range of applications.
[37] Such an architecture has been developed within IBM Research--namely, the Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA).
